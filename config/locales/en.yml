# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        body_html: Data in the lake is available to any POD participant to extract and reuse. It is up to the POD participant to consume and reuse the data responsibly. Libraries that seek to use POD data for uses that exceed the Minimum Standard for Data Reuse for Data Providers should exercise caution and investigate whether restrictions may apply to their intended use. This may include informing POD data provider contacts of the intended use.
